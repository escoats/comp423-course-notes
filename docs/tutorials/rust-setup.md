This tutorial will walk you through creating a dev container for programming in Rust, including how to create and connect a new repository!

## **Prerequisites**
Before getting started, make sure you've done the following:  

* Create a [Github](https://github.com) Account
* Install VSCode
* Install Git
* Install Docker Desktop

## **Setup: Create a Repository** üöß üöú
### 1. Create Local Directory and Initialize Git  

In your terminal, create a new directory for your project: 

```
mkdir rust-project
cd rust-project
```

???+ Note
    `mkdir` creates a new directory and `cd` navigates into it!

Initialize a new Git repository:
```
git init
```
Finally, create a README file and commit it to your repository:
```
echo "# Rust Project" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Add README"

```

???+ Note
    `echo "text" > README.md` writes the text output from the `echo` command into the README file. Put whatever you want inside the quotes (but make it descriptive)!

### 2. Create Remote Repository
On GitHub, create a new repository:

*  _Name:_ `rust-project`
*  _Description:_ "My rust project!"

Do not initialize the repository with a README - we already created one locally!

### 3. Link Local Repository to GitHub
In your project directory, add the GitHub repository as a remote:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/rust-project.git
```

Push your first commit to the remote repository:
```
git push -u origin main
```
???+ Note
    The -u flag creates a tracking relationship between the main branch in your local repository and the one in your remote repository. The full length of this flag is ```--set-upstream```.

## **Configure Dev Container** üê≥ üö¢
### 1. Add Dev Container Configuration
Open your `rust-project` directory in VSCode. 
Install the *Dev Containers* extension for VSCode.
Create a `.devcontainer` directory in the root of your project. Inside, create a file called `devcontainer.json`.

The `devcontainer.json` file contains the configuration for your development environment: 

```
{
  "name": "My Rust Project",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/rust:latest",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "settings": {},
      "extensions": ["rust-lang.rust-analyzer"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Reopen Project in Dev Container
In the VSCode command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container."

Make sure your dev container is running a recent version of Rust with `rustc --version` 

???+ Note
    The most recent version of Rust currently available is 1.84.0.

## **Hello World!** üëã üåé
1. To create a binary project, run `cargo new <project-name> --vcs none`.
```rust
cargo new hello-world --vcs none
```

???+ Note
    The `--vcs none` flag blocks the creation of another repository.

1. cd into your new package: `cd hello-world`.  


2. Edit your `main.rs` file to contain the following:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello COMP423!");
}
```

3. Build your file with `cargo build`. This command compiles your human-readable program (Rust code) and links any necessary dependencies, turning them into an executable file (binary).  


4. Run your program with `cargo run`. This command runs the file created in the previous step!
Your output should be:
```
Hello COMP423!
```

???+ Note
    If you've made any changes to your program after running `cargo build`, `cargo run` will re-compile and run the program in the same step!


If your output matches, you've successfully set up a dev container for Rust. Congratulations!üéâ
